# RFID-and-person-counter-


Objectives:-
It is to monitor the presence of people using proximity sensors, recording their entry and exit times using RFID cards and their number, turning on the lights when entering the first room, and saving electricity when everyone is late by turning off all the lights to ensure the greatest percentage of electricity savings.


The scientific idea:-
 It is the development of a system that efficiently tracks the presence of humans in a specific area and records their movements. This could have practical applications in security systems, tracking attendance in workplaces or schools, or even in studying human behavior in controlled environments.
And record the name, arrival and departure times, and ID number in an Excel sheet to facilitate the monitoring process.

Components:-
2 Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
OLED display (SSD1306)
2 Ultrasonic sensors (HC-SR04)
Relay module
RFID module (MFRC522)
I2C LCD display 16*2
Various passive components (resistors, wires, etc.)
